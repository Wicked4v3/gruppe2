            <p>In Railway Valley you are the manager of the railroad who is responsible for a whole railroad
              network full of crossings and junctions which are connected to all the stations and industries
              of the Railway Valley. Your job in this flash game is to build a system of railroads using your mouse
              and help the trains reach their destination points without any problems occurring. Along your way you
              need to collect as much money as you can to demolish obstacles, build your railways and pay fines if you
              get any. You need to remember in this game that balance plays a very important part of you because if this
              turns negative then the game will soon be over.
