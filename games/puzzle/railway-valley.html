                <p>
                    In Railway Valley you are the manager of the railroad who is responsible for a whole railroad
                    network full of crossings and junctions which are connected to all the stations and industries
                    of the Railway Valley. Your job in this flash game is to build a system of railroads using your mouse
                    and help the trains reach their destination points without any problems occurring. Along your way you
                    need to collect as much money as you can to demolish obstacles, build your railways and pay fines if you
                    get any. You need to remember in this game that balance plays a very important part of you because if this
                    turns negative then the game will soon be over.
                </p>
