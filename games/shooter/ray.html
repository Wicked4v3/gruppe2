            <p>Live a day in the life of Ray, your local street thug and hitman. You call the shots in this "Choose your own
              adventure game" with multiple paths and endings. Some scenes throughout the movie will give you a choice, in some
              places, the choice you pick will give you a number. At the end of the game you add all these numbers up and that will
              determine your rank, Not all choices throughout the movie will give you a rank but they offer you another way to do
              something. You cannot see every scene through one play of the game, In fact if you don't play it 4 times through you
              will miss at least 40 extra scenes. In the big mission some choices will cause you to die and you will be taken back
              to the choice again, not back to the start... Enjoy!
